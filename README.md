## 1. Kickoff

### Start a project journal

Try keeping a daily journal of your work. Describe a decision you recently made, or reason through a pending decision that’s hard to make. Pose big questions you’d like to explore next in your process, or explain solutions you’d like to prototype. Unpack learnings from user research. Frame up a conversation you’d like to have with a collaborator. Whatever’s on your mind, give yourself permission to listen and document it for 10 whole minutes.

### Stakeholder interviews
Sit down with relevant people in the team/company to understand where they are coming from and what their expectations are.

* Tell me about your role at [organization name].
* Tell me about your vision for the work you do at [organization name].
* Why did you start this project?
* Why does this work matter?
* What are your goals for the next 3–6 months?
* From your perspective, what are some of the critical audiences for [website url]?
* If you had to choose one, who would you say is the primary audience?
* Describe where you want to take people. What does the world look like if you’re successful?
* What do you know about your customers?
* What don’t you know about your customers?
* How do think people cope today, without the product you’re about to build?
* If a customer was telling a friend about your product, what would you want them to say?
* Who do you see as your competition? How are you different?
* Who inspires you online or elsewhere? Who do you want to emulate?
* What puts the success of this project at risk?
* Do we already have any idea of pricing for the final product?
* Do we have any idea of timeline to consider?
* Who else is involved?
* What’s happening next?

### Listing assumptions and hypothesis to be tested
* What is the definition of success for this project?
* In order to achieve that, what needs to be true? (What are we assuming to be true about users or about our capabilities?
* Let’s imagine we can travel to the future and see that the project failed. What were the causes?

Here is a general formula you can use to write a problem hypothesis:

```
Because [assumptions and gut instincts about the problem], users are [in some undesirable state]. They need [solution idea].
```

Example:

>Because their business model relies on advertising, social media tools like Facebook are deliberately designed to “hook” users and make them addicted to the service. Users are unhappy with this and would rather have a healthier relationship with social media tools. They would be willing to pay for a social media service that was designed with mental health in mind.

You can see in this example that my assumptions are:

- Users feel that social media sites like Facebook are addictive.
- Users don’t like to be addicted to social media.
- Users would be willing to pay for a non-addictive Facebook replacement.

These are the assumptions I’ll be researching and testing throughout the discovery process. If I find through my research that I cannot readily affirm these assumptions, it means I might not be ready to take on Mr. Zuckerberg just yet.

In my example, the interview research brought to light a new concern about social media I previously hadn’t considered: the “creepy” collection of personal data. I am left wondering, Would potential customers be more attracted to the idea of a social media platform built to prevent addiction, or one built for data privacy? To answer this question, I articulated a new, competing hypothesis:

> Because their business model relies on advertising, social media tools like Facebook are designed to gather lots of behavior data. They then utilize this behavior data to create super-targeted ads. Users are unhappy with this, and would rather use a social media tool that does not rely on the commodification of their data to make money. They would be willing to pay for a social media service that did not track their use and behavior.

I now have two hypotheses to test against one another: one focused on social media addiction, the other focused on behavior tracking and data collection.

## 3. Research
### Backwards research

Do your research based on the outcomes you need from it. Define the decisions your team needs to make, and work backwards to find which methods to use and which questions to ask:

1. Determine how the research results will be implemented (which helps to define the problem & the decisions you need to make).
2. To ensure the implementation of the results, determine what the final report should contain and how it should look.
3. Specify the analyses necessary to “fill in the blanks” in the research report.
4. Determine the kind of data that must be assembled to carry out these analyses.
5. Scan the available secondary sources and/or syndicated services to see whether the specified data already exist or can be obtained quickly and cheaply from others. (While you are at it, observe how others have tried to meet data needs like your own.)
6. If no such easy way out presents itself, design instruments and a sampling plan that will yield the data to fit the analyses you have to undertake.
7. Carry out the field work, continually checking to see whether the data will meet your needs. 8. Do the analysis, write the report, and watch it have its intended effect.

### In-depth interviews
#### Never ask users what they want
Asking users what they want will give you answers based on their limited experience. You are the expert in problem-solving, not them. Instead, ask these:

- What are you trying to get done?
- Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?
- Can you show me how you do it?
- Can you show me what’s frustrating about this current process?

*(source [Charles Liu](https://medium.com/user-research/never-ask-what-they-want-3-better-questions-to-ask-in-user-interviews-aeddd2a2101e))*

To be clear, your interviewees will not tell you:

- what to build;
- or how to build it.

But they absolutely can tell you:

- what problem they have;
- how they feel about it;
- and what the value of a solution would mean to them.

always ask the following two questions:

“What do you like about [blank]?”
“What do you dislike about [blank]?”

One common mistake is to spend too much time investigating what’s wrong with the current state of affairs. Naturally, you want your product to fix all the problems your customers face. However, you also need to preserve what currently works well, what is satisfying, or what is otherwise good about how users accomplish their goals currently. So it is important to ask about both in user interviews.

## 4. Synthethize the problem

### Color coding techniques for interview transcripts

#### By answers to study questions
1. Print interviews
2. Choose one color to each study question
3. Assign one color to each team member
4. Each team member highlights text with their color whenever there’s information about the question
3. Transcribe findings to post its of the corresponding colors
4. Cluster and prioritise.

*(source: [gov.uk](https://userresearch.blog.gov.uk/2017/12/20/how-we-did-a-large-scale-group-analysis-of-user-research-data/)*)

#### By rose, bud & thorn technique
It’s a way of coding the transcript, so when you go to do interviews you code them using these three colors. Rose is pink, where you capture things that are working well. Things in green are called buds, which seem to have potential for improvement. And blue, thorns, are pain points. So I go through my notes, and I codify that based on those three aspects, and then I start grouping all of those notes by categories, by topic, so in the end I will have very different clusters with the topics, and maybe one topic is really blue, it’s very thorny, and that’s a pain point, clearly. Or an area is very green, and that means that there’s a lot of opportunity to do something about that topic.

### Product Mad Libs
Write down several words for each of these and discuss them with your client.

```
{product name} {helps/lets} {audience noun} {verb} and {verb} {object} so they can {verb} {adverb}.
```

Example:
> Meetup helps people with specific interests discover and join local communities so they can meet in the real world.

```
{Sign up for/Join} {product name} to {verb} {plural noun} with {secondary audience noun}.
```

Example:
> Join Meetup to create and find local groups with people that share your interests!

## 5. Explore solutions

### Co-design exercise

This is an exercise that is great to help a large group of people feel like they have a say in a project, and generate ideas from many different perspectives in an organization.

1. Set an 8-up sketchboard template and pencil at each place where someone will be sitting.
2. Instruct them that they have to come up with 6 or more prototype ideas for the problem at hand (e.g. a home page, a critical sub page, an application) on the sheet. They should do rough sketches with text and minimal annotation.
3. Encourage them that anyone can sketch, and to use basic shapes (rectangles, lines, circles, triangles, arrows) if they feel challenged.Set a time limit. For the first round, 10 minutes or so is fine.
4. Start the clock, and allow them to sketch. Game show or other similar music can add to the experience.
5. At the end of the time limit, have each person pair up with someone who is not a member of their department of organization. Allow them to spend time presenting their ideas to each other, then critiquing those ideas. 2 minutes for presentation and 3 minutes for critique should be sufficient for each person (10 minutes total.)
6. While the discussion is taking place, hand out a 1-up sketchboard templates to each group.
7. Have them collaborate on a new prototype sketch using the 1-up sketchboard template.

Repeat, but each time have the groups combine into new groups that are twice the size of the previous. Groups of 2 become groups of 4, groups of 4 become groups of 8, and so on.

Note: With larger groups, you may want easel size sticky notes for later prototypes, or have technology in place (digital camera or document projector) to display the prototypes on the screen.Once you are down to 2 – 4 large groups, do presentations and critiques for the entire group.Collect the sketches for review by your team.

### Envision your future headline
Imagine yourself in a future world when your design has shipped. As you scroll through the news, you see a story about your work. What do the headline and subheadline say? Play with di erent wording and framing angles. If it’s helpful, continue the story by writing the article, or even the  rst few lines of it. Avoid discussing the  nished design in detail. Focus instead on the impact that the design has made on people —the larger story that it tells.

(*[Melody Quintana](https://medium.com/dropbox-design/designers-who-play-with-words-2ea8a7afb9bb)*)

### Define what should be obvious, easy, and possible
Obvious is all about always. The thing(s) people do all the time, the always stuff, should be obvious. The core, the epicenter, the essence of the product should be obvious.
Beyond obvious, you’ll  nd easy. The things that should be easy are the things that people do frequently, but not always. And  nally are the things that are possible. These are things people do sometimes. Rarely, even. So they don’t need to be front and center, but they need to be possible.

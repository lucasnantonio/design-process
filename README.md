# Design Process

Repository of high-quality questions, steps and resources for a solid 0-to-1 design process. It focuses on written content, template docs and frameworks, so do not expect links to trendy tools and icons. 

These tips have been collected for years in articles and books, and unfortunately some references were lost. If you recognise something as being yours, let me know and credits will be added.

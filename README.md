## Organize yourself
### Start a project journal 

Try keeping a daily journal of your work. Describe a decision you recently made, or reason through a pending decision that’s hard to make. Pose big questions you’d like to explore next in your process, or explain solutions you’d like to prototype. Unpack learnings from user research. Frame up a conversation you’d like to have with a collaborator. Whatever’s on your mind, give yourself permission to listen and document it for 10 whole minutes.

## Explore the problem

### Stakeholder interviews
Sit down with relevant people in the team/company to understand where they are coming from and what their expectations are.

* Why did you start this project?
* Why does this work matter?
* What are your goals for the next 3–6 months?
* Describe where you want to take people. What does the world look like if you’re successful?
* What do you know about your customers? 
* What don’t you know about your customers?
* How do people cope today, without the product you’re about to build?
* If a customer was telling a friend about your product, what would you want them to say?
* What are your core messages? What do you want people to understand?
* Who do you see as your competition? How are you different?
* Who inspires you online or elsewhere? Who do you want to emulate?
* Are there any associations that you want to avoid? What would alarm or deter your audience?
* Do we already have any idea of pricing for the final product?
* Procedural:
    * Do we have any idea of timeline to consider?
    * Who else is involved?
    * What’s happening next?
* If this is a post-mvp/v2 project.
    * How are people using it?
    * What are people saying about it? What do you want them to say?

### Foundational Research

## Synthethize the problem

##### Synthesis of interview transcripts 
Print interviews -> Use color coded markers to highlight answers to specific questions -> Transcribe findings to post its of the corresponding colors -> Cluster and prioritise.

## Explore

### Envision your future headline
Imagine yourself in a future world when your design has shipped. As you scroll through the news, you see a story about your work. What do the headline and subheadline say? Play with di erent wording and framing angles. If it’s helpful, continue the story by writing the article, or even the  rst few lines of it. Avoid discussing the  nished design in detail. Focus instead on the impact that the design has made on people —the larger story that it tells. (*[Melody Quintana](https://medium.com/dropbox-design/designers-who-play-with-words-2ea8a7afb9bb)*)

### Define what should be obvious, easy, and possible
Obvious is all about always. The thing(s) people do all the time, the always stu , should be obvious. The core, the epicenter, the essence of the product should be obvious.
Beyond obvious, you’ll  nd easy. The things that should be easy are the things that people do frequently, but not always. And  nally are the things that are possible. These are things people do sometimes. Rarely, even. So they don’t need to be front and center, but they need to be possible.

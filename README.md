# Design Process

Repository of *high-quality* design process advice, snippets, frameworks, thinking tools, questions and exercises for a solid 0-to-1 product design process. Design is not perfectly linear so be reminded this is not a checklist. Pick and choose whatever works for your project.

Content is curated from books and articles, if you know the source of something that has no credits, please submit a correction.

## 0. Set the stage
### Start a project journal 

Try keeping a daily journal of your work. Describe a decision you recently made, or reason through a pending decision that’s hard to make. Pose big questions you’d like to explore next in your process, or explain solutions you’d like to prototype. Unpack learnings from user research. Frame up a conversation you’d like to have with a collaborator. Whatever’s on your mind, give yourself permission to listen and document it for 10 whole minutes.

## 1. Project Kickoff

### Stakeholder interviews
Sit down with relevant people in the team/company to understand where they are coming from and what their expectations are.

* Tell me about your role at [organization name].
* Tell me about your vision for the work you do at [organization name].
* Why did you start this project?
* Why does this work matter?
* What are your goals for the next 3–6 months?
* From your perspective, what are some of the critical audiences for [website url]?
* If you had to choose one, who would you say is the primary audience?
* Describe where you want to take people. What does the world look like if you’re successful?
* What do you know about your customers? 
* What don’t you know about your customers?
* How do think people cope today, without the product you’re about to build?
* If a customer was telling a friend about your product, what would you want them to say?
* Who do you see as your competition? How are you different?
* Who inspires you online or elsewhere? Who do you want to emulate?
* What puts the success of this project at risk?
* Do we already have any idea of pricing for the final product?
* Do we have any idea of timeline to consider?
* Who else is involved?
* What’s happening next?

### Listing assumptions and hypothesis to be tested
* What is the definition of success for this project?
* In order to achieve that, what needs to be true? (What are we assuming to be true about users or about our capabilities?
* Let’s imagine we can travel to the future and see that the project failed. What were the causes?

## 2. Research
### In-depth interviews
#### Never ask users what they want
Asking users what they want will give you answers based on their limited experience. You are the expert in problem-solving, not them. Instead, ask these:

- What are you trying to get done?
- Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?
- Can you show me how you do it?
- Can you show me what’s frustrating about this current process?

## 3. Synthethize the problem

#### Synthesis of interview transcripts 
Print interviews -> Use color coded markers to highlight answers to specific questions -> Transcribe findings to post its of the corresponding colors -> Cluster and prioritise.

### Personas

### Four forces of switching

### Product Mad Libs
Write down several words for each of these and discuss them with your client.

```{product name} {helps/lets} {audience noun} {verb} and {verb} {object} so they can {verb} {adverb}.```

```{Sign up for/Join} {product name} to {verb} {plural noun} with {secondary audience noun}.```

## 4. Explore solutions

### Co-design exercise

This is an exercise that is great to help a large group of people feel like they have a say in a project, and generate ideas from many different perspectives in an organization. 

Set an 8-up sketchboard template and pencil at each place where someone will be sitting.Instruct them that they have to come up with 6 or more prototype ideas for the problem at hand (e.g. a home page, a critical sub page, an application) on the sheet. They should do rough sketches with text and minimal annotation. Encourage them that anyone can sketch, and to use basic shapes (rectangles, lines, circles, triangles, arrows) if they feel challenged.Set a time limit. For the first round, 10 minutes or so is fine.Start the clock, and allow them to sketch. Game show or other similar music can add to the experience.

At the end of the time limit, have each person pair up with someone who is not a member of their department of organization.Allow them to spend time presenting their ideas to each other, then critiquing those ideas. 2 minutes for presentation and 3 minutes for critique should be sufficient for each person (10 minutes total.)While the discussion is taking place, hand out a 1-up sketchboard templates to each group.Have them collaborate on a new prototype sketch using the 1-up sketchboard template.

Repeat, but each time have the groups combine into new groups that are twice the size of the previous. Groups of 2 become groups of 4, groups of 4 become groups of 8, and so on.Note: With larger groups, you may want easel size sticky notes for later prototypes, or have technology in place (digital camera or document projector) to display the prototypes on the screen.Once you are down to 2 – 4 large groups, do presentations and critiques for the entire group.Collect the sketches for review by your team.

### Envision your future headline
Imagine yourself in a future world when your design has shipped. As you scroll through the news, you see a story about your work. What do the headline and subheadline say? Play with di erent wording and framing angles. If it’s helpful, continue the story by writing the article, or even the  rst few lines of it. Avoid discussing the  nished design in detail. Focus instead on the impact that the design has made on people —the larger story that it tells.

### Define what should be obvious, easy, and possible
Obvious is all about always. The thing(s) people do all the time, the always stuff, should be obvious. The core, the epicenter, the essence of the product should be obvious.
Beyond obvious, you’ll  nd easy. The things that should be easy are the things that people do frequently, but not always. And  nally are the things that are possible. These are things people do sometimes. Rarely, even. So they don’t need to be front and center, but they need to be possible.
